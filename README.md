## Overview
This project examines how Massachusetts residents are distributed across municipalities by median household income.

## Data
American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2023)
Median household income (S1901)
Total population (B01003)

## Methods
Municipalities were grouped into income quintiles based on median household income. Population-weighted summaries were used to compare the number of municipalities to the share of residents living in each income group.

## Key Takeaway
Lower-income municipalities contain a disproportionately large share of the state population, while higher-income municipalities tend to be smaller in population despite similar counts of municipalities.
